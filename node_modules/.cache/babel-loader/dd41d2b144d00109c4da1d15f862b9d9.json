On one hand, I saw people coming together, first responders working in dreadful conditions to save lives, people raising money for the victims, calls for justice from everyone in the nation regardless of party or political belief.

During this work and seeing all of the same needs I have experienced throughout the country being echoed in my community, where I was raised, I knew that we needed better representation and I decided to run for Congress. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"white gridCenter marginBottom\">So as you can see my run for congress is a choice I made to continue my calling of service. To use my experience as a combat medic, scientist, and activist to not only lead but work alongside, hand in hand with each of you as we work together to heal and grow our community. I am so thankful that you are here and can't wait for you to join me in my campaign.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"white gridCenter marginBottom\">Chris Bellingham for Congress 2022</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"aboutQuote gridOneTwo\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"aboutPadding gridCenter\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p> \"I am running for congress because as combat medic, scientist, and public spirited individual I will work every day to heal this district through sound, rational policies.
