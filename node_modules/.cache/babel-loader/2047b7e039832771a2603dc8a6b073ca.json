How could this happen? Who could hate us this much? How should I respond to this tragedy? And then, I watched two things happen at once, one which filled me with hope and one with dread. On one hand, I saw people coming together, first responders working in dreadful conditions to save lives, people raising money for the victims, calls for justice from everyone in the nation regardless of party or political belief. On the other hand, I saw how this impacted my Muslim brothers and friends who were both appalled at the violence and tragedy, and now being blamed for it, targeted for their beliefs and identity in some sick form of constant trauma.

We fought in places like Korengal, Nuristan, and Helmand provinces. I lead a team of line medics in combat, earned the rank of sergeant, and earned achievement and merit awards. Upon leaving the military, I came home to my nation, then stricken by global recession, and threw myself back into service immediately by serving meals to the unhoused population at Santa Monica Beach, working in a skid row, and bankrolling a documentary that focused on homelessness. While doing this, I attended Santa Monica College and worked as a lab technician while helping the Chemistry Club's educational outreach program serving the inner-city schools in Los Angeles. I then transferred to UC Santa Barbara where I earned a bachelor's in chemistry. It was at UC Santa Barbara when tragedy struck again, and I, like so many students across the country, experienced the horror of a school shooting. At this point in my life, I was taken back to those feelings after 9/11 and those same questions came back. How could this happen? Who could hate us this much? How should I respond to this tragedy?

I met so many amazing and beautiful people in our community and really got to see firsthand how our local government and representatives were not only not meeting our needs, but they weren't even speaking to us. Instead of focusing on the population of CA-25, Mike Garcia was voting against COVID relief and speaking to insurrectionists on January 5th, 2021 in Washington DC. Through this work and seeing all of the same needs I have experienced throughout the country being echoed in my community, where I was raised, I knew that we needed better representation and I decided to run for Congress.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"white gridCenter marginBottom\">So, as you can see, my run for congress is a choice I made to continue my service. To use my experience as a combat medic, scientist, and activist to not only lead but work hand in hand with each of you as we work together to heal and grow our community. I am so thankful that you are here and can't wait for you to join me in my campaign.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p className=\"white gridCenter marginBottom\">Chris Bellingham for Congress 2022</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"aboutQuote gridOneTwo\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div className=\"aboutPadding gridCenter\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p> \"I am running for congress because as a combat medic, scientist, and public spirited individual, I will work every day to heal this district through sound, rational policies.
