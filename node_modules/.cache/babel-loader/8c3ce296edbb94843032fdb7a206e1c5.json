On one hand I saw people coming together, first responders working in dreadful conditions to save lives, people raising money for the victims, calls for justice from everyone in the nation regardless of party or political belief. On the other hand I saw how this impacted my Muslim brothers and friends who were both appaled at the violence and tragedy, and now being blamed for it, targeted for their beliefs and identity in some sick form of constant trauma. So with this perspective I decided to not only enlist and serve my country but to do so as a combat medic, i did not wish to participate in the spread of violence but rather be there to heal and save the lives of my brothers in arms. Over my time in service I had 5 combat tours over 27 months and served as a Combat Medic to 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum New York where we fought in the most intense combat for decades. Places like Korengal, Nuristan, and Helmand provinces. I lead a team of line medics in combat, earned the rank of sergeant, garden achievement and merit awards. Upon leaving the military I came home to my Nation, stricken by a now global recession, and threw myself back into service immediately serving meals to the unhoused population at santa monica beach, working in a skid row, and bankrolling a documentary that focused on homelessness. While doing this I attended Santa Monica College and worked as a lab technician while helping the Chemistry clubs educational outreach program serving the inner city schools in Los Angeles. I then transferred to UC Santa Barbara where I earned a bachelors in chemistry. It was at UC Santa Barbara where tragedy struck again and I like so many  students across the country experienced the horror of a school shooting. At this point in my life I was taken back to those feelings after 9/11 and those same questions came back. How could this happen? Who could hate us this much? How should I respond to this tragedy?
