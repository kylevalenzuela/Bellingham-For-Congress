How could this happen? Who could hate us this much? How should I respond to this tragedy? And then, I watched two things happen at once, one which filled me with hope and one with dread. On one hand, I saw people coming together, first responders working in dreadful conditions to save lives, people raising money for the victims, calls for justice from everyone in the nation regardless of party or political belief. On the other hand, I saw how this impacted my Muslim brothers and friends who were both appalled at the violence and tragedy, and now being blamed for it, targeted for their beliefs and identity in some sick form of constant trauma. So with this perspective, I decided to not only enlist and serve my country but to do so as a combat medic. I did not wish to participate in the spread of violence but rather be there to heal and save the lives of my brothers in arms. Over my time in service, I had 4 combat tours over 26 months and served as a combat medic to the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum New York, where we fought in the most intense combat for decades. We fought in places like Korengal, Nuristan, and Helmand provinces. I lead a team of line medics in combat, earned the rank of sergeant, and earned achievement and merit awards.

While doing this, I attended Santa Monica College and worked as a lab technician while helping the Chemistry Club's educational outreach program serving the inner-city schools in Los Angeles. I then transferred to UC Santa Barbara where I earned a bachelor's in chemistry. It was at UC Santa Barbara when tragedy struck again, and I, like so many students across the country, experienced the horror of a school shooting. At this point in my life, I was taken back to those feelings after 9/11 and those same questions came back. How could this happen? Who could hate us this much? How should I respond to this tragedy?

He identified climate change as the greatest threat to national security that we face, the truth of which I saw every day at work, looking at the data showing the loss of ecological life and then also seeing what this will mean for migration once parts of the earth become inhabitable. He spoke about the injustice of economic disparity in our communities, words I had not heard so concretely since studying the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr. He spoke of patriotism in a way that reminded me of president John F. Kennedy, having an unshakable faith that America can do amazing and incredible things if we just put our minds and ambitions to it. Yet despite the insurmountable odds and the many issues, Bernie showed he had a constant sense of optimism, which brought back the lessons I learned from reading Hellen Keller. Within weeks of that debate, I found myself on the ground in Iowa as a field organizer for the Bernie Sanders campaign, traveling up and down America, shaking hands and having conversations with folk from all walks of life, and learning just how much we all have in common with one another. During my travels I saw even more truth of the realities that Bernie spoke of from that stage in October. I saw Ferguson still damaged from the wake of civil unrest due to racial injustice, New Orleans incredibly still waiting on repairs from hurricane Katrina, and everywhere I went there were signs of destitute poverty throughout America. After the primary, with a fellowship award from The Mission Continues, I eventually founded a non-profit organization called the Chosin Foundation whose purpose was to throw events raising money for scholarships that would go to children who have lost their parents in the Global War on Terror.
